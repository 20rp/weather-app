<h1> New Weather App </h1>

<p> This is a redesigned version of a coding challenge I attempted before starting my current job. 
    It's a simple weather app that will eventually allow the user to select a location and be served realtime weather information.
    The design focuses on responsiveness and mobile first. The data is served from the <a href="https://weatherapi.com/"> WeatherAPI </a> service.
